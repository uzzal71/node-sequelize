Sequelize is a Node.js-based Object Relational Mapper that makes it easy to work with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL databases, and more. An Object Relational Mapper performs functions like handling database records by representing the data as objects. Sequelize has a powerful migration mechanism that can transform existing database schemas into new versions. Overall, Sequelize provides excellent support for database synchronization, eager loading, associations, transactions, and database migrations while reducing development time and preventing SQL injections.
